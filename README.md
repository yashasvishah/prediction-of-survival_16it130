# prediction-of-survival_16it130
Project is focuses on Analysis of different machine learning Algorithms and select best algorithm for my dataset so that successful outcomes I can have. Prediction about survival of a person on titanic dataset gives a categorical value so that I need to apply classification algorithms which comes in supervised learning. To make data visualization I have used graph plotting and outcome also I have shown using graph so that we have better idea about model and it’s outcomes analysis using different algorithm is also plotted. To identify accuracy and errors RMSE is used and from that accuracy is found. In this project I learn about numerical data manipulation with numpy library of python, for plotting data Matplotlib library and for dataset handling pandas library working of python.
This project can predict a person can survive or not according it’s features like Age, Sex,  pclass, parch, sibsp for that first applying suitable algorithm for our dataset and output variable and train our machine so that it learns about given data and gives output for new data. It is better if we train machine using enough amount of data so that it can be predict for any type of value of our data.
